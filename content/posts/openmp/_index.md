This is a series of summaries and notes for my learning of OpenMP. Most of the content is based on [Tim Mattson's (Intel) Introduction to OpenMP tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLX-Q6B8xqZ8n8bwjGdzBJ25X2utwnoEG&si=3M8PjMPUdt8cXozy), which are some very intuitive and easy-to-understand videos that I highly recommend to anyone who is interested in learning OpenMP or parallel computing in general.
